### [Reporting Bugs](#reporting-bugs)
{: #reporting-bugs}

#### Before Submitting a Bug Report

A good bug report should describe the issue in detail. Generally speaking:

- Make sure that you are using the latest version.
- Remember that these are unofficial builds, it's usually prudent to investigate an issue before reporting it here or in Fedora!
- Collect information about the bug:
  - `rpm-ostree status -v` usually helps
- Image and Version
- Possibly your input and the output
- Can you reliably reproduce the issue? And can you also reproduce it with older versions?

### [Pull Requests](#pull-requests)
{: #pull-requests}

#### Before Submitting a Pull Request

A good pull request should be ready for review before it is even created. For all pull requests, ensure:

- You have no unnecessary changes, including whitespace changes
- You have tested your changes
- For substantive changes, you include evidence of proper functionality in the pull request in addition to the build results.
- Your commits are [verified](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification)

### [How to test incoming changes](#how-to-test-incoming-changes)
{: #how-to-test-incoming-changes}

One of the nice things about the image model is that we can generate an entire OS image for every change we want to commit, so this makes testing way easier than in the past. You can rebase to it, see if it works, and then move back. This also means we can increase the amount of testers!

We strive towards a model where proposed changes are more thoroughly reviewed and tested by the community. So here's how to do it. If you see a pull request that is opened up on an image you're following you can leave a review on how it's working for you.

## Building your images with Github Actions (recommended)

Start from your own fork with a branch for the pull request/feature you want to develop. Follow the instructions [here](https://blue-build.org/how-to/cosign/) to add your own keys to verify your own custom image. From there it's recommended you go to .github/workflows/build.yml and comment out all of the image variants except the ones you use/intend to test. This drastically speeds up your workflow runtime. Then just go to actions > build-secureblue and select run workflow, making sure you select the branch you just set up.

Once it's done building, go to your VM running Fedora Atomic and rebase to your newly built image. This is a string that starts with 'rpm-ostree rebase ostree-unverified-registry:ghcr.io/', followed by the repo and package name. This can be found by checking the "packages" section in the sidebar of your fork. Take the docker pull command and copy the repo and package reference. Then, append the tag, which is in the format `br-{branchName}-{fedoraVersion}`. Your command should look like this:

```
rpm-ostree rebase ostree-unverified-registry:ghcr.io/YOURUSERNAME/YOURIMAGENAME:br-YOURBRANCHNAME-41`
```

## [Building Locally](#building-locally)
{: #building-locally}

The minimum tools required are git and a working machine with podman enabled and configured.
Building locally is much faster than building in GitHub and is a good way to move fast before pushing to a remote.

### Clone the repo

    git clone https://github.com/secureblue/secureblue.git

### Build the image

First make sure you can build an existing image:

    podman build . -t something

Then confirm your image built:

    podman image ls

TODO: Set up and push to your own local registry

### Make your changes

This usually involved editing the `Containerfile`. Most techniques for building containers apply here. If you're new to containers, using the term "Dockerfile" in your searches usually shows more results when you're searching for information.

Check out CoreOS's [layering examples](https://github.com/coreos/layering-examples) for more information on customizing.

## Using Blue-build locally

### Requirements

- [Blue-build CLI](https://github.com/blue-build/cli)
- Podman
- git

Secureblue already includes `bluebuild` but running locally requires customizing policy.json for your user to allow pulling a few unsigned images.

#### Policy.json configuration

On secureblue only pre-configured signed images are allowed to be pulled. Following repos need to be configured:

- docker.io/mikefarah/yq `Unsigned`
- ghcr.io/blue-build/cli `Unsigned`
- ghcr.io/blue-build/modules `Unsigned`
- quay.io/fedora-ostree-desktops `Unsigned`

Copy `/etc/containers/policy.json` to `~/.config/containers/policy.json` and then add rules using podman CLI:

- `podman image trust set --type accept docker.io/mikefarah/yq`
- `podman image trust set --type accept ghcr.io/blue-build`
- `podman image trust set --type accept quay.io/fedora-ostree-desktops`

### Clone the repo

    git clone https://github.com/secureblue/secureblue.git

### Making changes

Configuration is stored in `recipes` folder in form of YAML files. Other files to be added to the image are stored in `files`. `common` holds pluggable modules to add to your custom image. `general` and `securecore` hold configs for the desktop and server images, respectively. Modules are detailed in [BlueBuild's documentation](https://blue-build.org/learn/getting-started/).

### Building

- Open terminal in root of your cloned repo.
- Run `bluebuild build recipes/<your custom recipe>.yml`

### Testing

Run the image using `podman run` to get a root shell in your newly built image and verify the changes made prior.
